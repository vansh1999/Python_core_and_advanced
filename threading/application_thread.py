# creating Threads

t1 = threading.Thread(target = greet_them , args = (people,))
t2 = threading.Thread(target = assign_id , args = (people,))


# start the Thread
t1.start()
t2.start()

# join the Threads
t1.join()   # if we don't join, execution time will be printed after name 1 and id 1.
t2.join()

# use of join() - Your intepreter will stay running until all the threads terminate


et = time.perf_counter()
print("execution time is " , et-st)

# You see this time it didnâ€™t execute sequentially. And the overall execution time is reduced by 50%. So that is why we use Threads.
# execution time is 3.006 seconds
