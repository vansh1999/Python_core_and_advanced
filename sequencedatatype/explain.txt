#1 list vs array

Basically, Python lists are very flexible and can hold completely heterogeneous,
 arbitrary data, and they can be appended to very efficiently, in amortized constant time.
  If you need to shrink and grow your list time-efficiently and without hassle, they are 
  the way to go. But they use a lot more space than C arrays.

For almost all cases the normal list is the right choice.
 The arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over C arrays,
  which give you kind of strongly typed containers (see docs), 
  with access to more C-like types such as signed/unsigned short or
   double, which are not part of the built-in types. I'd say use the arrays
    module only if you really need it, in all other cases stick with lists.

    eg - in matrix add or mul we use list instead of array , as python does not support array , not-build-in


1. List 
> heterogeneous container for items
>list is mutable
>ordered

2. Tuple
> heterogeneous
> Immutable
> ordered

3. Set
> A set, in Python, is just like the mathematical set.
> not hold duplicate values
> unordered
> mutable

4. dictionary

dictionary holds key-value pairs.
