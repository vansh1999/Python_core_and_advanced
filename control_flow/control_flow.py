# 1 The break Statement

# he break statement is allowed only inside a loop body. When break executes, the loop terminates.

# 2 The continue Statement

# The continue statement is allowed only inside a loop body.
#  When continue executes, the current iteration of the loop body terminates,
#  and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop. 


# 3 The pass Statement

# The body of a Python compound statement cannot be emptyâ€”it must contain at least one statement. 
# The pass statement, which performs no action, can be used as a placeholder when a statement is
#  syntactically required but you have nothing specific to do.
